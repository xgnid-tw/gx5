A personal Discord bot built with Go, used to automate payment tracking for group purchases. It pulls transaction data from a Notion database, calculates how much each person owes, and sends reminders via Discord DM if an amount is overdue or exceeds a threshold.

This tool is not intended for public useâ€”it's a private utility for managing personal expense settlements more efficiently.
